    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on popularity trends within the music industry. Specifically, this study examines the variation in radio and streaming music preferences from 2013 to 2022. Using the Billboard APIs, we can observe correlation between streamed music and radio music. Further, using the Genius API, we will look at the number of unique words in radio music versus streamed music. I am interested in whether or not the vocabulary of radio music and streamed songs have progressed at a similar rate during the last decade. "

    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis is that streaming preferences were once in alignment with the songs on the radio, but this has occurred less and less over time. Factors responsible for this change could include an increase in streaming availability, making all types of music more accessible to audiences."

    "\n",
    "These results indicate that people once streamed similar music to what was played on the radio, but this pattern has been occurring less and less from 2013 to 2022. Further, the vocabulary of streamed music versus radio was once the same, but the number of unique words in streaming music has drastically increased, while the number of unique words in radio music has remained static. \n",
    "\n",
    "These results leave me with more significant questions, such as why the number of unique words in streaming music continues to grow. Perhaps radio is meant for a wide general audience, making it impossible for the preferences of all audience members to be exemplified. Has pandemic lockdown impacted the time that people spend listening to the radio, making listeners more likely to stream new songs? Streaming versus radio preferences began to take a big shift in 2014, indicating that this hypothesis could not be the only factor responsible for the relationship between radio and streaming.\n"
